<h2><strong>Activities</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li><p><em>Debate</em></p></li>
  <p>Switch Side Policy Debate. Through this policy, I not only discuss a multitude of competing ideas,
  but also argue from both sides of widely disputed issues. I strive to give others the same opportunity for intellectual stimulation.
Over the past two years, I have helped expand my debate team, from a struggling club of 15 members, to a buzzing force of over 100 debaters,
leading my team to first place in our community debate league. As team president, I teach new debaters fundamentals in communication theory,
while facilitating formal and informal debates. Playing a dual role of an Instructor and a competitor has allowed me to establish debates
as a lasting forum for the discussion of ideas. Similarly, the lessons i learned, will be instrumental in my future work as an entrepreneur and an engineer,
which require the capacity to approach problems critically and clearly articulate complex ideas.</p>
